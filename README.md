Useful Aws Tutorials and Documentations

## Prerequisite 
The below examples are experimented in `AWS Academy Leaner Lab`. Hence do **configure** your own IAM roles/users to allow the use of the various AWS resources.

We will be using the following for the creation of AWS services:
- IAM role
    - asd
- PEM file
    - `EC2` -> `Network & Security` -> `Key Pairs` -> `Create key pair`
        - **Name:** cs301-aws-generic
        - **Private key file format:** .pem

## Examples 
<details>
<summary>Public and Private Subnet </summary>

<img src="static/vpc-private-public-subnet.png">  <!-- weight = "" height = "" -->

### Summary
We will be creating a 
- 1 vpc *(IP address of 10.0.0.0/16)* to allow **65534** hosts (256*256 - 2)
- 1 public subnet *(IP address of 10.0.1.0/24)* to allow **254** hosts (256 - 2)
- 1 private subnet *(IP address of 10.0.2.0/24)* to allow **254** hosts (256 - 2)

The key difference between a private and a public subnet is that private subnet associated with a route table that **doesnâ€™t have a route to an internet gateway**.

### Implementation Steps

**NOTE:** You can click **VPC and more** to create a new VPC with 2 public and 2 private subnet configured automatically for you. Click [here](./static/aws-create-vpc-and-more.png) to see the visualisation!


1. Create VPC
    - `VPC (service)` -> `Virtual private cloud (left navigation menu)` -> `Your VPCs` -> `Create VPC`
        - **Name:** vpc-demo
        - **IPv4 CIDR:** 10.0.0.0/16
2. Create Subnet for both private and public
    - `VPC (service)` -> `Virtual private cloud (left navigation menu)` -> `Subnets` -> `Create subnet`
        - **VPC ID:** <select your VPC from (1)> 
        - **Subnet name:** subnet-public-1, subnet-private-1
        - **Availability Zone:** us-east-1a , us-east-1b *(you can allow AWS to choose for you but I assign manually for better control of resources later on)*
        - **IPv4 CIDR block:** 10.0.1.0/24 , 10.0.2.0/24 respectively
        - CLICK `add new subnet` to add more
3. Create a new Internet gateways
    - `VPC (service)` -> `Virtual private cloud (left navigation menu)` -> `Internet gateways` -> `Create internet gateway`
        - **Name tag:** demo-internet-gateway
    - Click on your gateway, from `Actions` -> `Attach to VPC` 
        - **Available VPCs**: <select your VPC from (1)> 
4. Create Route tables for your private and public subnets
    - Do note that a default route table is already attached during the creation of VPC. In this case we will be using the **default route table for the private subnet** since it is not routed to any internet gateway.
        <img src="static/aws-default-route-table.png">
    - Change the name of the default route table for the private subnet
        - `VPC (service)` -> `Virtual private cloud (left navigation menu)` -> `Route tables`
        - Find the default route table that is under your vpc and hover your mouse-tip to the `-` under the `Name` column.
            - **Edit Name:**: rt-private-1
    - Create route table for public subnet
        - `VPC (service)` -> `Virtual private cloud (left navigation menu)` -> `Route tables` -> `Create route table`
            - **Edit Name:**: rt-public
            - **VPC:** <select your VPC from (1)> 
        - Once created, click on `Edit Routes` and `Add route`
            - **Destination:** 0.0.0.0/0
            - **Target:** Click `Internet Gateway` and you will see the gateway that you have attached in (3)
5. Change the route table for your public subnet *(private subnet should already be attached to the default route table which you renamed at (4))*
    - `VPC (service)` -> `Virtual private cloud (left navigation menu)` -> `Subnets`
    - Click on your public subnet *(subnet-public-1)*
    - Under `Route table`, click `Edit route association` and change the route table ID
        - **Route table ID:**: rt-public
6. YAY! you have successfully setup a private and a public subnet under your own VPC! You can visualise the resource map by clicking on your `VPC`. From the image below, you can see that the two different subnets are associated with different route table. Only the public subnet can access the internet gateway.

<summary>CS301 Research Implementation </summary>

### Summary
The research focuses on evaluating the efficiency of processing large csv files and inserting into a Postgres database through:
1. Recurring Lambda function
2. AWS GLUE

Since this is just a research, there are quite alot of hard-coded values which we should not be doing in real production!

### Implementation Steps (Brief)
1. Recurring lambda function (reference [here](https://medium.com/swlh/processing-large-s3-files-with-aws-lambda-2c5840ae5c91))
    - Lambda does not provide 3rd party libraries out of the box. We have to zip the files and upload the lambda codes.
    - Zip the psycopg2 folder of your choice together ([awslambda-psycopg2 Github repo](https://github.com/jkehler/awslambda-psycopg2)) with the lambda handler code found [here](./scripts/research_lambda_handler.py)
    - Remember to increase the default time limit to 15 minutes.
2. AWS Glue
    - Attached an Amazon S3 endpoint to the VPC. Check [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/connection-S3-VPC.html) for more details.
    - Create Crawler to get s3 files and process columns
    - Establish connection with Postgres database and create Crawler as well
    - Copy/upload the python script and create job. [Glue script](./scripts/research_glue_etl_test.py)

### Results - Lambda
The usual practice of ingesting data from a large CSV file is to send records to a message queue and allow the processing of each record to run asynchronously. The team simulated this environment by invoking an AWS Lambda function to open the CSV file and create a generator to receive each row. These rows are processed and sent to the database. 

As each lambda function has a maximum duration limit of 15 minutes, the function regularly checks if the remaining time is more than the stipulated time (defined by us) after each row retrieval. Another lambda function will be invoked asynchronously with the same event object and the additional offset value. This offset value helps to determine the last position of the processed records.

    <img src="static/aws-research-lambda-insert-time.png">
</p>

The whole process took approximately 28 minutes for 478,817 records. The team reckons that the duration will increase as the processing algorithm gets more complex. 

### Results - Glue
The entire CSV file is processed and only sent to the database once all algorithms run successfully. The insertion of  478,817 records took approximately 3 seconds and the glue job took approximately 3 to 5 minutes.
